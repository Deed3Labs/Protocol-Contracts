# The Deed Protocol - Smart Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts for **The Deed Protocol**, which facilitates decentralized (P2P) Real World Asset transactions via Smart Contracts. These contracts represent real world assets as Secured Digital Representations (SDRs), ensuring seamless integration with external validation services and enabling future enhancements.

> ⚠️ **BETA WARNING**: This protocol is currently in beta. Use at your own risk. The contracts have not been audited and may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The Deed Protocol uses legal engineering to merge technology with Real World Assets by tokenizing ownership, validation and administration. Each property deed or title is represented as a unique non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain, providing decentralized, secure, and transparent records of ownership.

Key components of the protocol include:
- **DeedNFT**: The core ERC721 NFT representing real-world assets with dynamic metadata support.
- **Validator**: Asset validation and verification system with multi-asset support.
- **ValidatorRegistry**: Registry for managing authorized validators and their capabilities.
- **FundManager**: Financial operations including payment processing and commission management.
- **MetadataRenderer**: Standardized metadata management with ERC-7496 dynamic traits.
- **ValidatorFactory**: Factory for deploying standardized validator instances.
- **Subdivide**: Asset subdivision into ERC1155 units for property division.
- **Fractionalize**: Fractional ownership via ERC20 tokens for REIT functionality.
- **FractionToken**: ERC20 tokens representing fractional asset shares.
- **FractionTokenFactory**: Factory for deploying fraction token contracts.

## Asset Types
The protocol supports various types of real-world assets:
- **Land**: Real estate properties and land parcels
- **Vehicle**: Automotive and transportation assets
