## What CLEAR Is

CLEAR is a fintech app and financial co-op built to help renters become owners.

Our mission:

- `Turning Renters into Owners`
- `Stop Renting. Start Owning. Take the CLEAR path.`

Simple idea:

> We use collective member power to help people get into homes and build real equity over time.

## The Main Products

## 1) Clear Savings (ESA)

- ESA means `Equity Savings Account`.
- You save money there.
- In the CLEAR model, this is part of your path toward home entry.

## 2) Clear Equity (ELPA)

- ELPA means `Equity-Lease Participation Agreement`.
- This is the home residency model CLEAR is building around.
- Goal: monthly payments help grow your equity, not just pay rent forever.

## 3) Clear USD (`$CLRUSD`)

- CLEAR’s stable-value token used for program settlement.
- Built with strict role controls for minting and burning.

## 4) Clear Assurance

- The protection layer around home condition and repairs.
- Goal: protect both member living quality and home value.

## 5) Clear Credit

- Credit and repayment rails inside the protocol stack.
- Used for controlled credit line and servicing flows.

## How the Member Path Is Supposed to Work

1. Open and fund your ESA.
2. Build buying power toward home entry.
3. Move into a home under the ELPA framework.
4. Grow equity over time through your payment flow.

CLEAR’s core promise is to make ownership a path, not a one-time gate.

## What Is Live Today vs What Is Still Being Built

### Live now in the repository

1. `ClearUSD` token contract.
2. `ESADepositVault` for 1:1 mint/redeem logic.
3. Reserve/pricing contracts.
4. Credit primitive contracts.
5. Core asset/validator contracts.

### Still in buildout/roadmap form

1. Full ELPA lifecycle as a dedicated on-chain module.
2. Full trust and beneficial-interest transfer operations.
3. Full production-grade assurance operations stack.

This distinction is important. CLEAR already has real infrastructure, but not every final product promise is fully finished in code yet.

## Why Members Care

Traditional renting:

- You pay monthly but usually build no ownership.

Traditional mortgages:

- Large upfront cash and strict credit gates.

CLEAR target model:

- Lower entry barrier path.
- Equity growth designed into the member journey.
- Co-op framing where platform incentives are intended to align with member equity growth.

---

## Safety and Trust Notes

From the current protocol repo status:

- The project is labeled alpha/developer preview.
- Contracts are not yet represented as fully production-hardened for broad public scale.
- More audit, governance hardening, and legal rollout work is still required.

What this means for members:

- CLEAR is building real rails now.
- CLEAR still needs to complete hardening steps before full mature scale.

---

## What You Should Ask CLEAR Before Joining at Scale

1. What parts are live today, and what parts are still roadmap?
2. How is your money protected in the ESA flow?
3. How does equity actually accrue in your specific contract?
4. What are the fees, penalties, and exit options?
5. What happens if you move, miss payments, or want to sell?
6. What legal rights do you have to beneficial interest and transferability?

---

## The Bottom Line

CLEAR is aiming to build a new ownership path between renting and traditional mortgages.

Today, it already has meaningful technical foundations (`ClearUSD`, ESA vault, reserve and credit rails). The full end-state member ownership experience (especially ELPA legal/operational depth) is still being completed.

If CLEAR executes well, the model can become a practical path for renters to build ownership over time.
