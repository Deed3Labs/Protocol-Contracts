# Protocol Overview

The Deed Protocol is a comprehensive decentralized platform for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, validation, and management. Built on Ethereum and Base networks, the protocol enables the creation, validation, and trading of digital representations of real-world assets through a robust smart contract ecosystem.

## üéØ Core Mission

The Deed Protocol bridges the gap between traditional real-world assets and blockchain technology by providing:

- **Secure Tokenization**: Convert real-world assets into tradeable digital tokens
